		Here’s a practical Laravel task to help you test your skills for an interview. It includes CRUD operations, relationships, authentication, API development, and frontend integration, which are common requirements for a developer with one year of experience:

		Task: Build a Simple Blog Application
		Requirements:
		Authentication System:

		Implement user registration and login using Laravel Breeze or Laravel UI.
		Allow only authenticated users to access the blog management panel.
		Models and Relationships:

		Create models for User, Post, and Category.
		Relationships:
		A User has many Posts.
		A Post belongs to one Category.
		A Category has many Posts.
		CRUD Operations:

		Implement CRUD for:
		Categories
		Posts
		Include validation for form inputs (e.g., title is required, content must have a minimum length, etc.).
		API Development:

		Create a REST API for:
		Fetching all posts with their categories and authors.
		Creating a post.
		Updating a post.
		Deleting a post.
		Use appropriate HTTP status codes and responses for the API.
		Search and Filtering:

		Implement a feature to search posts by title.
		Filter posts by category.
		Frontend Integration:

		Create a dashboard for managing posts and categories.
		On the homepage, display a list of posts with their categories and authors.
		File Upload:

		Allow users to upload an image for each post.
		Display the uploaded image on the frontend.
		Pagination:

		Add pagination to the post listing (both API and frontend).
		Middleware:

		Protect routes to ensure only authenticated users can manage posts and categories.
		Add middleware to log the IP address and user ID for each request to a log file.
		Testing:

		Write feature tests for the API to ensure CRUD operations work as expected.
		Evaluation Criteria:
		Proper use of Laravel features (e.g., Eloquent, middleware, validation).
		Code readability and structure (e.g., using repositories or service classes if needed).
		Efficient handling of database queries and relationships.
		Clear and user-friendly UI/UX for the frontend.
		Handling edge cases (e.g., validation errors, unauthorized access).
		Writing clean and meaningful tests.
		Would you like a step-by-step guide or additional hints for any part of this task?
